**WaterBot** is a [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) mod that helps you water your crops while staying as vanilla as possible.

Upon watering a plant, the mod will control your player to water the rest of your plants, fetching water when required. Any buttons pressed while active will turn the bot off.
